### Vision : 

To design a system for ease of Individual Internet access and circumventing Individual censorship while working with open 
communities.

### Statement:

Establishing the Radio communication between two or more systems by establishing communication between two or more open browsers 
within the Radio frequency range with the helpful combination of [GNU radio](https://gnuradio.org)-Software Defined Radio(SDR 
software + RF Hardware) with Firefox web browser addon.

   * **Problem:** 
     * * When user is refused for Internet connection(Wireless/Wired).
     * * When Specific user is censored to access Web.
 
   * **The Objectives and Implementations of This project includes:**
     * * Establishing the Radio communication between two or more systems by establishing communication between two or more [open browsers] systems within the Radiofrequency range.
     * * This is by integrating (Firefox) browser with GNU radio -and SDR Hardware. Taking the advantage of developing and implementing [Firefox] addon(s). 
     * * Taking the advantage of complete Open policy implementation.


**System Design Implementation**: [HERE]( /Design-docs/README.md )



**Advantages:**
 
A System/Device which is censored(refused internet connection) to access Web, can Privately access Web:

 * * This helps in communicating with nearby systems(having Internet access) within the radio frequency range when your(or 
someones) Internet service Provider refused to provide user based internet and/or when there is individual user defined 
Censorship for accesing Web.
 * * Need no direct internet access(or WiFi network) for two or more system communication within the range.
 * * Increases the anonymity and privacy of the user by Hiding the true (IP) address of Orginating system.
 * * Avoiding the internal censorship while connecting to other systems for accessing the Internet.
